This thesis presents the development and implementation 
of a real-time anomaly surveillance system. The system 
leverages advanced techniques from computer vision, machine 
learning, and artificial intelligence to enable proactive 
monitoring and detection of anomalies in various environments. 
Through the utilization of state-of-the-art models and 
algorithms, the system provides real-time analysis of multiple 
camera feeds, automatically detects anomalies, and triggers 
appropriate actions for a timely response. The system offers a 
user-friendly interface, customizable settings, and integration 
with email notifications for efficient anomaly management. 
Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate the 
effectiveness and practicality of the system in enhancing 
situational awareness and improving overall security.
